# Embedded-ML-with-Person-Detection

With the continuous advancement of science and technology, in the past 20 years, DATA has become more and more important to human beings in our daily life. Whether it is the life of citizens, or the government's layout of the city's water, power, even network supply, it is inseparable from the help of big data. When it comes to big data, we cannot do without the concept of Machine Learning (ML), which can be the key to unlocking the value of data and making decisions that keep a project ahead of its competition. Incorporating the advantages of machine learning, we find that more and more embedded hardware is widely used in practice by designers. Our topic project for this semester is to train a humanoid detection device. The purpose of our project is to realize the initial prediction and detection of human-shaped objects.
